## Basic Processes
The actual code is a little more sophisticated than that. Having short term recursive
memory, release detection, fall detection, compensation for human interference and
reaction times, as well compensation as collision interference. Not sure if any of that
is important but might be nice to put into the research investigations to show the
steps taken to reduce possible sources of uncertainty.
